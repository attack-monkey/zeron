## Important!!

Work on Zeron has stopped.  
Instead we reccomend *hyperapp* as a functional front-end framework.

Hyperapp utilises the same core principles of Zeron (State in one place, State is immutable, Functional over oo, etc.)

## Please check out...

I have put together a hyperapp + typescript seed project at:

[Hyperapp Seed - Typescript](https://github.com/attack-monkey/hyperapp-seed-ts)

### Features

- typescript / tsx
- parceljs
- bootstrap
- hyperappRouter
- auto code splitting + lazy loaded components
- immutable update (iu-ts)
